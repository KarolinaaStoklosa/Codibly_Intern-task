# Frontend Intern task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It displays the paginated list of items. You can filter results by id putting a value into the input.
If you click on the row a modal displays showing all properties of the item. 
There is also a pagination component to switch the pages. 
I have also made some unit test using React-testing-library.

## What I use :

- Typescript
- React
